Cricket Counter For Pebble
==========================

A basic cricket umpire's counter app for Pebble. It saves taking an actual counter out! It can currently track balls, overs and wickets.

To reset the app state (for example, when a new innings starts), long press the wicket button (the middle button on the right).

## Building

You will need the [Pebble SDK](http://developer.getpebble.com/) installed before building. I've only tested the current version against SDK 2.3, although I suspect slightly older versions would also be OK.

It's a standard build from here, so:

    pebble build

Should get you a PBW to install.

Happy hacking!
